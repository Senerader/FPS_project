# FPS_project
FPS project created for a Software Project Course

In the year 2019, during the spring semester, I have decided to create the first perssonal shooter game on
Unreal Engine 4. That is my first complicated project in my first game development framework.

Please follow up the progression from my GitHub repo.

Thank you.
